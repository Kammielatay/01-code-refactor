`#`Code Refactor

`##`Description:

This is my code refactoring assignment for week one of coding bootcamp. This week, we were hired by a marketing agency, Horiseon, to refactor their existing code to be more accessible. Being as though web accessiblity is becoming increasingly important, we were asked to make it more semantic and a little cleaner than we received it. 

A few things that Horiseon asked for were:
    `*` semantic HTML elements
    `*` elements to follow a logical structure
    `*` add alt attributes to the image elements
    `*` consolidate the CSS selectors and properties

By making this changes, the site is more optimized for search engines and the codebase is more sustainable for the long-term benefits. It also ensures that those persons with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies.
